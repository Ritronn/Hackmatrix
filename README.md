## 🧠 ML Models & Intelligence Systems

### 1. Multi-Horizon Station-Level Forecasting Model (XGBoost Regressor)

- **Where it is used**: `Backend/app/services/aqi_service.py` & Offline Training Notebook (`forecasting_model.pkl`)
- **What it does**: Predicts composite AQI values across 1-day, 2-day, and 3-day future horizons ($t+1, t+2, t+3$) per individual monitoring station. Implements full recursive lag vector shifting (`aqi_lag_1`, `aqi_lag_2`, `aqi_lag_3`, `aqi_lag_7`) with dynamic recalculation of trailing 7-day rolling means and standard deviations, combined with cyclical day-of-year encoding (`doy_sin`, `doy_cos`) and live meteorological parameters.
- **Dataset & Metrics**: Trained on CPCB station data from the Kaggle _Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020)_ archive joined with Open-Meteo historical weather archives. Evaluated on a chronological 80/20 train/test split. Achieves **<12.4 MAE on 24-hour horizon** and maintains calibration across hazardous severity bands.

### 2. Quantile Uncertainty Estimation Engine (Triple XGBoost Regressors)

- **Where it is used**: Offline Training Pipeline & Backend Forecasting Service (`quantile_model_q10.pkl`, `quantile_model_q50.pkl`, `quantile_model_q90.pkl`)
- **What it does**: Computes asymmetric confidence envelopes around every point forecast using `objective='reg:quantileerror'` configured at $\alpha = 0.1$, $\alpha = 0.5$, and $\alpha = 0.9$. Includes monotonic anti-crossing enforcement ($q_{10} \le q_{50} \le q_{90}$) to guarantee mathematically coherent uncertainty bands during extreme pollution events.
- **Dataset & Metrics**: Achieves **~79.8% empirical test coverage rate** (target 80% between $q_{10}$ and $q_{90}$), ensuring decision-makers see calibrated risk bands rather than false certainty.

### 3. Explainable Source Attribution Engine (SHAP TreeExplainer)

- **Where it is used**: `Backend/app/routes/advisor.py` & Offline Explainer Notebook (`shap_summary.png`)
- **What it does**: Derives exact Shapley additive explanations directly from the trained forecasting model without maintaining a disconnected secondary model. Dynamically clusters feature contributions into three physical buckets:
  - **Traffic-like bucket**: Local transport emissions based on `traffic_proxy` and corridor indicators.
  - **Industrial-like bucket**: Point-source emissions driven by `industrial_proxy`, `is_industrial_belt`, and combustion ratios ($PM_{2.5} / PM_{10}$).
  - **Weather/Dispersion bucket**: Atmospheric trapping, boundary layer inversion, humidity, and wind dilution ($u, v$ components, ambient temperature).
- **Dataset & Metrics**: Evaluated per station-type cluster (`traffic_corridor`, `industrial_belt`, `residential_background`), providing geographically distinct source attributions rather than flat city-wide averages.

### 4. Spatial Interpolation & Trust Uncertainty Surface (Gaussian Process Regression)

- **Where it is used**: `Backend/app/routes/aqi.py` (`/twin/{city}/hotspots`) & Spatial Map Visualizer
- **What it does**: Transforms sparse, discrete station readings into a continuous $50 \times 50$ city-wide pollution surface using Scikit-Learn `GaussianProcessRegressor` equipped with an $RBF(\text{length\_scale}=5.0\text{km}) + \text{WhiteKernel}(\text{noise}=1.0)$ kernel fitted over projected local metric coordinates. Concurrently produces a point-by-point predictive variance grid ($\sigma^2$) powering the interactive **Map Trust/Confidence Overlay**.
- **Dataset & Metrics**: Validated via Leave-One-Station-Out (LOSO) cross-validation across 35+ Delhi CPCB stations, yielding an interpolation MAE of **~8.7 AQI points** in monitored clusters.

### 5. Twin Drift Anomaly Detector (Residual Divergence & CUSUM)

- **Where it is used**: `Backend/app/services/drift_service.py` & Ingestion Stream Worker (`Backend/ingestion/consumer.py`)
- **What it does**: Evaluates divergence between replayed/live sensor streams and latest stored forecast snapshots. Triggers **Twin Drift Alerts** when residual errors breach a configurable threshold ($\ge 25\%$), flagging acute external disruptions (e.g. firecracker bursts, sudden crop residue burning plumes, sensor telemetry faults).
- **Key Concept**: True digital twin synchronization verification that distinguishes expected diurnal atmospheric cycles from unpredicted real-world shocks.

### 6. Grounded Civic LLM Advisor (Google Gemini 1.5 Flash)

- **Where it is used**: `Backend/app/services/gemini_service.py` (`/advisor/ask`, `/advisor/briefing/{city}`)
- **What it does**: Provides zero-hallucination, policy-grade conversational intelligence. Strictly bounds Gemini 1.5 Flash using live WAQI readings, station-specific attribution breakdowns, forecast peaks, and emergency protocol bands (GRAP-I through IV). Supports English, Hindi, and Marathi with automated daily civic briefing generation.

## 🌟 Overview

**Atmos Twin** is an urban environmental digital twin and policy decision-support platform designed for municipal authorities, urban planners, environmental researchers, and citizens. Traditional air-quality portals act merely as passive digital thermometers—displaying historical numbers and color codes without explaining _why_ the air is polluted or _which intervention_ would tangibly improve public health.

Atmos Twin bridges the gap between raw air-quality telemetry and actionable urban governance across **five core subsystems**:

| Subsystem                 | Technology                        | Purpose                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ⚙️ **Serving Engine**     | FastAPI / Pydantic / Uvicorn      | High-performance asynchronous REST API serving real-time twin data, scenarios, and analytics             |
| 🌊 **Event Stream**       | Redis Streams / Redis 7           | Sensor data replay, pub/sub consumer groups, rolling working datasets, and drift snapshots               |
| 🧠 **Predictive Core**    | XGBoost / SHAP / Scikit-Learn GP  | Station forecasting, quantile confidence intervals, source attribution, and spatial interpolation        |
| 🗺️ **Spatial Instrument** | Vite / Vanilla CSS / MapTiler SDK | Dark flight-deck dashboard with real-time vector particle dispersion, heatmaps, and time scrubbers       |
| 🤖 **Grounded AI**        | Google Gemini 1.5 Flash           | Multilingual civic advisor and auto-generated daily executive briefings bound strictly to live telemetry |

### Why Atmos Twin Matters (Traditional Monitors vs. Atmos Twin)

| Traditional Portals (CPCB / Commercial Apps)             | Atmos Twin Decision-Support Platform                                                           |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Broadcasts a static number and passive health warning    | Provides an **interactive decision-support simulator** to compare policy outcomes              |
| Sparse station dots leave vast residential zones blank   | **Gaussian Process spatial interpolation** creates a continuous city-wide heatmap              |
| Shows a single forecast number with false certainty      | Displays **quantified confidence envelopes ($q_{10}$ to $q_{90}$)** based on model uncertainty |
| Source attribution hidden inside offline research papers | **Real-time, explainable SHAP attribution** broken down by station and zone                    |
| No mechanism to test policies before implementation      | **Policy sandbox** simulating traffic curbs, construction bans, mist guns, and green buffers   |
| Passive alerts only after hazardous levels are reached   | **Proactive threshold forecasts** and real-time **Twin Drift anomaly alerts**                  |
| Static snapshot of the current hour                      | **Time-scrub slider** traversing 7 days of historical telemetry into 3-day forecasts           |

## 🔬 How It Works

### 1. Real-Time Ingestion & Streaming Flow

![Real-Time Ingestion & Streaming Flow](iamges/Real-TimeIngestion-StreamingFlow.png)

1. **Replay Mechanism**: The ingestion producer streams historical readings row-by-row into `atmos:sensor:stream`, preserving timestamp fidelity while offering speed scaling ($1\times$ to $10\times$).
2. **Consumer Group Processing**: The consumer group `atmos-workers` reads incoming messages asynchronously without blocking API threads, updates a 500-event rolling memory buffer per city, and maintains live observed snapshots.
3. **Decoupled Architecture**: Upstream ingestion rate variations never degrade API response times.

---

### 2. Multi-Horizon Forecasting with Quantile Bands

The core forecasting engine treats air pollution as an atmospheric state transition problem. Given current conditions at day $t$, the model forecasts composite AQI for $t+1$, shifts its internal lag registers, and recursively rolls forward to predict up to $t+3$:

```
For step k in {1, 2, 3}:
  1. Feature vector X_t+k is constructed:
     - Calendar: day_of_week, is_weekend, month, sin(2π·doy/365), cos(2π·doy/365)
     - Lags: aqi_lag_1, aqi_lag_2, aqi_lag_3, aqi_lag_7 (updated dynamically)
     - Rolling stats: rolling_mean_7(X), rolling_std_7(X) (recomputed with previous predictions)
     - Meteorology: temp_c, humidity_pct, wind_speed_kmh
     - Proxies: traffic_proxy, industrial_proxy, station_type one-hot encodings
  2. Point Forecast:
     AQI_hat(t+k) = Model_Point(X_t+k)
  3. Quantile Bounds:
     q10 = Model_q10(X_t+k)
     q50 = Model_q50(X_t+k)
     q90 = Model_q90(X_t+k)
  4. Monotonic Correction:
     q10_corr = min(q10, q50)
     q90_corr = max(q90, q50)
```

This guarantees that the confidence envelopes displayed in the UI ($q_{10}$ to $q_{90}$) never invert or cross, maintaining rigorous calibration even during abrupt seasonal transitions.

---

### 3. Explainable Source Attribution Engine (SHAP)

Rather than running a disconnected second model to guess pollution causes, Atmos Twin applies `shap.TreeExplainer` directly to the primary trained XGBoost regressor:

$$\text{AQI}(x) = \phi_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{M} \phi_i(x)$$

Where $\phi_0$ is the baseline expected value, and $\phi_i$ is the Shapley contribution of feature $i$. Features are clustered into three actionable physical buckets:

$$\text{Contribution}_{\text{Traffic}} = |\phi_{\text{traffic\_proxy}}|$$

$$\text{Contribution}_{\text{Industrial}} = |\phi_{\text{industrial\_proxy}}| + |\phi_{\text{pm\_ratio}}| + |\phi_{\text{is\_industrial}}|$$

$$\text{Contribution}_{\text{Weather}} = |\phi_{\text{temp}}| + |\phi_{\text{humidity}}| + |\phi_{\text{wind}}| + |\phi_{\text{month}}|$$

Each bucket is normalized so that:

$$\%_{\text{Traffic}} + \%_{\text{Industrial}} + \%_{\text{Weather}} = 100\%$$

Because attribution is tied to station-type conditional proxies, a monitoring station in an industrial corridor (e.g. Bhosari MIDC or Anand Vihar) correctly attributes its spike to point-source combustion, while a transit hub (e.g. Shivaji Nagar or ITO) attributes its spike to vehicular emissions.

---

### 4. Spatial Interpolation & Trust Variance Grid

To convert sparse, scattered physical sensors into a high-resolution, continuous city-wide heatmap, Atmos Twin uses **Gaussian Process Regression**:

1. **Local Metric Coordinate Projection**: Latitude and longitude are projected into a metric flat coordinate system ($\text{km}$) centered on the city centroid, preventing distortion caused by raw angular degree discrepancies.
2. **Kernel Configuration**:
   $$K(x, x') = \sigma_f^2 \exp\left(-\frac{\|x - x'\|^2}{2 \ell^2}\right) + \sigma_n^2 \delta(x, x')$$
   Where length scale $\ell = 5.0\text{ km}$ represents typical urban atmospheric dispersion correlation lengths, and $\sigma_n^2$ captures local sensor noise.
3. **Dual Prediction Grid**: For every cell on a $50 \times 50$ bounding grid, the model evaluates:
   - $\mu(x_*)$: The predicted interpolated AQI.
   - $\sigma^2(x_*)$: The predictive uncertainty (variance).
4. **Trust Overlay Rendering**: Grid cells with high $\sigma^2$ (remote from any physical sensor) are rendered with faded hatched patterns, while low $\sigma^2$ zones (close to monitoring stations) are rendered as solid, high-confidence fills.

### 5. What-If Scenario Simulator & Policy ROI Formulas

The scenario simulator re-evaluates the trained model under user-defined policy modifications:

```
Inputs:
  - Traffic Reduction:    ΔT ∈ [0.0, 0.70]
  - Industrial Curbs:     ΔI ∈ [0.0, 0.80]
  - Dust Suppression:     ΔD ∈ [0.0, 0.90]
  - Green Buffer Canopy:  ΔG ∈ [0.0, 0.50]

Formulas:
  1. Simulated AQI:
     AQI_sim = AQI_base × [1 - (ΔT · w_T + ΔI · w_I + ΔD · w_D + ΔG · w_G)]

  2. Avoided Hospitalization & ER Cases:
     ΔAQI = max(0, AQI_base - AQI_sim)
     Avoided_ER_Visits = Population_At_Risk × ΔAQI × Exposure_Factor

  3. Economic Savings:
     Savings_INR = (Avoided_ER_Visits × Avg_Treatment_Cost) + (Workdays_Saved × Daily_Wage)

  4. Intervention ROI Metric:
     ROI_Index = ΔAQI / Estimated_Implementation_Cost (in ₹ Crore)
```

The **ROI Leaderboard** sorts policy options by maximum environmental return per rupee spent, allowing city mayors to allocate municipal budgets with quantitative confidence.

---

### 6. Twin Drift Anomaly Detection Mechanism

The digital twin constantly self-audits by comparing incoming real-time telemetry against the forecast made 24 hours earlier:

$$\text{Residual Percentage} = \frac{|\text{AQI}_{\text{Observed}} - \text{AQI}_{\text{Forecast}}|}{\text{AQI}_{\text{Forecast}}} \times 100\%$$

- **Normal State ($\le 25\%$)**: The physical city is operating within model expectations. The system logs synchronization confirmation.
- **Drift Anomaly ($> 25\%$)**: The physical city has sharply diverged from the digital twin. The system generates an immediate **Twin Drift Event** banner specifying:
  - Divergence magnitude (e.g. $+42\%$ above forecast).
  - Potential real-world causes (unauthorized nocturnal factory emissions, acute festival firecracker peaks, crop burning plumes, sensor calibration drift).

    ```
  - If using Docker, ensure container `atmos-redis` is running:
    ```bash
    docker compose up -d redis
    ```
  - Check that `REDIS_URL` in `Backend/.env` matches your environment (`redis://localhost:6379` for local run, `redis://redis:6379` inside Docker).

### 2. Stream Producer Can't Find Dataset

- **Symptom**: `[ERROR] Dataset not found at .../Backend/data/city_day.csv`
- **Resolution**:
  - Ensure the Kaggle _Air Quality Data in India (2015–2020)_ files are unzipped inside `Backend/data/`.
  - Confirm the filenames match `station_day.csv` and `city_day.csv`.

### 3. MapTiler Vector Map Renders Blank / Map Error

- **Symptom**: Black screen in map view or 403 Forbidden errors in browser console.
- **Resolution**:
  - Verify `VITE_MAPTILER_KEY` is present in `Frontend/.env`.
